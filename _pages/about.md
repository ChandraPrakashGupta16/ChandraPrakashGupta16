Reserch Interest
------
In my research, I explore diverse areas of law to contribute to the development of a robust legal framework. In addressing contemporary legal challenges, I focus on critical aspects of law that impact society and governance. Some of my past and planned research includes:

- Labour Law: Examining the rights of workers, industrial relations, and the evolving nature of employment contracts.
- Family Law: Analyzing laws related to marriage, divorce, child custody, and succession, with an emphasis on gender justice.
- Criminal Law: Investigating procedural and substantive criminal law to ensure fairness and justice in the legal system.
